# README

Just doing a hello github to try things out.

- To find out how to pull/push/commit 
- explore the different tools available for a project.
- obviously there is no code here yet.

## Testing Ruby

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
```

## Testing Ada

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO;
use Ada.Text_IO;

package Text is
  S : constant String := "hello";
```

and **this** and *that*.

To install see [INSTALL](./INSTALL.md).

OR see [hello script](src/hello.rb).
